    <h2>The first type...</h2>
    <p>
        ...of musician is someone who goes from 0 to 1. When listening to a song by a first type musician you
        immediately hear that they were able to create a new sound. This does not need to be a new genre. A new rhythym
        or special sound do the trick.
        <br>
        Let me give you an example.
        When you listen to Rampa's &amp; &amp;ME's remix of the song "More Love" by Moderat (<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Uax2Yw48U">YouTube</a>) you will hear this sound first appearing
        around the 1:40 mark. As far as I know, this is new (and I listen to a lot of music...). I do not even know what
        that sound is but it is exciting and drives the song forward.
